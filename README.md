💰 Daily Budget Tracking System (Flask Web Application)

The Daily Budget Tracking System is a web-based application designed to help users efficiently manage their daily income and expenses. Built using Python (Flask) and SQLite, the system allows users to record financial transactions, track spending habits, and monitor their overall balance in real time.
